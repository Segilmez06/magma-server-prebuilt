# Prebuilt Magma server
## This is not an official repo of Magma server! I just downloaded by myself and did some game config changes for quick server setup.

You can get official Magma server installation files and docs at: https://magmafoundation.org/

:heavy_check_mark: This repo contains:
- Downloaded and configured server
- Jar file for installation

:x: This repo not contains:
- Eula: Eula isn't accepted. You need to accept it.
- World: I didn't generated the world. You can generate it by yourself with custom seed.

You can get this repo with running `git clone https://github.com/Segilmez06/magma-server-prebuilt`.
